# Scenario World Narrative

## More democracy and economic progress

By 2032, **the number** and [intensity]() of armed conflicts have decreased in the last decade as peaceful solutions are successfully pursued at the international level through a multi-faceted approach. 
The international community is taking responsibility for conflicts that stem from remnants of colonial history and, in some territories, solutions are being successfully found through international mediation. Countering the previous wave of undemocratic power shifts, many state governments around the world have been strengthening democratic institutions and procedures – moving higher up the scale of democracy – and regime violence is diminishing in many regions as a result.
Economic development in third countries and global initiatives to reduce financial inequality (e.g. conditional debt cancellation) reduce the proportion of economic migrants within the flows of migration. In addition to further economic development, third countries now face lower wealth inequality and less poverty, while having better living standards and better access to health care. In transit countries , the economic situation and political stability improve and, as a result, part of the migrants decide to stay in these countries instead of continuing their travel to initially intended destination countries in Europe (or elsewhere). At the same time, regional solutions to improve economic and social conditions in countries or territories of origin reduce the overall pressure on transit countries. 

## Rising transparency and awareness for human rights

Supported by international jurisprudence, respect for human rights improves and minority rights are increasingly recognised globally. There are transnational (and properly enforceable) regulations to protect vulnerable groups, accompanied by technological and social developments that increase minorities' awareness of their rights. Strong international civil society organisations collaborate to provide networks for minority groups and potential asylum seekers to report human rights violations and educate on international protection rights. Through the use of new technologies, oppression of minority groups is monitored and made transparent and is gradually receding from previous years. Mechanisms and technological infrastructure are in place to allow oppressed and vulnerable people to apply for international protection without increasing the risk of retaliatory punishment or forcing them to cross borders. 

##Consequences of climate change are recognised and addressed

Worsening climate impacts increase displacement and insecurity. In third countries, urbanisation is intensifying as – due to climate impacts – there is less arable land and opportunities for traditional farming, while greater urban economic capacities are driving population movements. 
Increasing environmental awareness is contributing to innovative approaches to irrigation and food distribution, including the improvement of regional structures to strengthen nutritional security. Climate change promotes a discussion that land and its use are inextricably linked to people's identity and well-being; international regulations to reduce conflicts related to land appropriation follow. Technology reduces resource scarcity by improving the production and distribution of various goods, including food and water. 
International non-governmental organisations are pioneering a possible revision of international legal standards with regard to climate migrants fleeing countries with unsustainable living conditions. At the international level, there are more and more successful court cases regarding the recognition of climate change-induced displacement as a criterion for protection. A coalition of countries seeking regional cooperation is supporting climate change-induced refugees. Technology is used to protect people from the effects of natural disasters (e.g. predicting floods, droughts, etc.). Expanded fair trade campaigns have proven increasingly popular and new global regulatory frameworks are paying off, each helping to level the playing field for small agribusinesses in developing countries.

## Digitalised asylum procedures

In 2032, a number of operational changes and supportive policies are shifting the approach to upholding international protection commitments. For example, asylum applications are often fully processed electronically and remotely (e.g. by conducting interviews online) in countries of origin. For asylum seekers with a positive asylum decision, safe pathways from the country of origin to the country of destination are ensured. These operational changes greatly speed up asylum procedures and result in fewer people engaging in irregular migration. 
Comprehensive information sharing between governments, agencies and some private actors enables improved services for asylum seekers, caseworkers and managers. If necessary, blockchain technology is used to prove identity and increase data protection. Occasional database inconsistencies and algorithm errors may lead to miscalculations and disruptive cyberattacks sometimes cause service outages. However, these are limited in number and scope. User-controlled private data enable reliable and faster artificial intelligence-assisted application processing. Organisations working in the field co-operate better with each other and provide information to speed up the processes of identity validation and travel history verification. In addition, biometric systems (facial, iris, voice and gait recognition) have become much more reliable as well as more portable and therefore more widely used in the identity verification process. 

## New opportunities for digital networks and platforms

Asylum seekers and other migrant groups are using digital technologies in a number of innovative ways. Regulated, mediated and trusted social media provide reliable information for various types of migrants and asylum seekers while respecting privacy by default. Protection of minority groups has been reinforced through successful social media campaigns, strategies and technologies that exist to debunk fake news and curb hate speech. At the same time, decentralised finance applications enable secure, global access to their own financial resources for migrants and asylum seekers.
Virtual spaces blur the line between physical and digital life in the social and cultural spheres and enable families to live on a transnational basis. Many education and employment opportunities can be pursued from almost anywhere. Catching up on missed vocational training (during transit or due to conflict) is possible (in conjunction with open online courses) and has been broadly adopted among migrant communities.
