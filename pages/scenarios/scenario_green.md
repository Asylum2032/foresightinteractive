# Scenario World Narrative

## Unofficial agreement of international zones of influence

The geopolitical world of 2032 has settled into an **uneasy stability**, with major world powers having reached an unofficial agreement to solidify their respective zones of influence around the world. This has led to less sabre rattling and has **reduced the threat of large-scale armed conflict**. **Economic development programmes are launched in transit countries**  where an increasing number of asylum seekers have been blocked on their way to preferred destinations. While the multipolar geopolitical world has matured and hardened its ‘borders’, it has also realised the necessity for transit countries to have and maintain social and political stability. This has led to **recognition by global power centres that transit countries’ burdens should be widely shared** and that efforts should be made to ensure the viability of certain regions.


## Focus on economic development in transit countries
In this scenario development activity, transit countries are understood as countries in the route between countries of origin and the EU.   
**The economic development of transit countries**, particularly along borders and within migrant and refugee communities, has been the focus of many intra-governmental initiatives and public-private partnerships. These developments have a **mixed track record regarding the treatment of employees**, the safety of their working conditions and links to crime and corruption. At the same time, new community economic opportunities, education systems and collaboration between local and migrant populations have emerged in more successful instances. Migrants and asylum seekers in economically developing transit countries have found opportunities to participate **in many economic sectors – characterised by both unskilled labour force and educated workforce using skill-intensive technologies** – including various types of telework.

## Increased control over personal data and remote asylum procedures
**Remote asylum procedures** as a supplement to the established procedures have done much to **expedite decisions** on asylum applications. However, the imperfect analysis algorithms used to speed up application processing are known to demonstrate **biased evaluations** unable to appropriately account for unique applicant circumstances. Digital operations rely on secure, user-controlled profiles that asylum seekers create and utilise to access various services, including aid in the form of restricted-use, government-backed digital currencies. 
**Individual digital autonomy and control over personal data** have increasingly become foundational digital governance policy in a number of economically powerful nations. This shift has begun reshaping the relationship between people, their data and social institutions through the rise of decentralised autonomous organisations and next-generation internet technologies. As these projects tend to be open source, the technologies that ensure security and autonomy of personal data are replicable, while the **asylum seekers' profile and identity systems** have proven reliable and **robust against digital attacks.** Furthermore, the ability to collect and monitor anonymised data enables large-scale analysis and monitoring of individual contexts and environments to keep people more safe and secure, regardless of their status as a citizen or asylum seeker. In some cases, intelligent systems have been employed to use digital profiles to better match asylum seeker skills, training and experience with **sponsorship opportunities** in asylum granting states. 
However, the emphasis on user control and data sovereignty has not removed the concern regarding abuses of digital surveillance. Though intra-governmental and/or international organisations attempt to transparently regulate the use of data for surveillance activities, not all countries comply with these efforts and there remain many organisations (public and private as well as criminal) that continue to conduct **both mass and targeted surveillance.** 

## Expansion of ‘dark web’ in response to digital surveillance of oppressed minorities

One arena in which digital surveillance practice remains particularly divisive is the issue of respecting and protecting minority groups. Minority rights have been increasingly recognised and protected in some geopolitical regions, particularly those in which democratic governing principles are being strengthened and supported.   However, **minority-group protection policies are by no means universal**, particularly in those regions where democracy is withering and more authoritarian governance systems are being reinforced. There is strong evidence that despite protective policy meant to regulate digital networks and technologies, both state and criminal actors have been using digital surveillance to target and actively harass minority groups within some regions. Thus, despite the regulatory and mediating actions that have been taken to create a safer and more reliable social media landscape, the **‘dark web’** of anonymous and uncensored networks has only **expanded and increased its capabilities.** While criminal elements drive the development of these decentralised, untraceable, encrypted social media, it has become an essential communication tool for oppressed people living under regimes of constant digital surveillance and physical threat. 

## Intensified environmentally-rooted migration

Food and water shortages are becoming more habitual, of longer duration and creating more intense scarcity. Despite the deployment of numerous technologies to mitigate **climate change-induced extremes** – heat, drought, desertification, typhoons/hurricanes, floods, etc. – the unpredictability of when, where and at what intensity the effects of climate change may manifest dampens the efficacy of technological solutions. In some areas, where strong support for third countries exists, financial aid and transparent land ownership policies are tied to and allow for localised rebuilding and resettling. However, outside of these supportive conditions, there are many regions where the **migration drivers rooted in environmental changes** are becoming more intense. In these situations, many migrant groups are unable to apply for asylum before ecological disruptions inspire dangerous, life-threatening societal responses, such as forcible displacement, targeted oppression and civil conflicts.
