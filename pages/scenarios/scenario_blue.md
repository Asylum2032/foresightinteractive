# Scenario World Narrative

## Tense but stable geopolitical situation

The tension between the geopolitical blocs has led all sides to seek stabilisation. To maintain the _status quo_, they aim to avoid regime changes and large-scale migration in all parts of the world. 
The support for the economic development in the global South is an important part of this effort and it includes technological as well as financial aid. Many **authoritarian governments** profit from this support. 
They **use new technologies to pacify their populations** by providing cheap food, minor economic development and escape from everyday life via digital entertainment.

## Misuse and benefit of new digital possibilities

In countries of origin, **surveillance technologies** (including the use of social media and mobile telephones) are used by governments to target dissident individuals. "The surveillance state" across several countries allows for more targeted, keyhole identification of dissidents and/or minorities and subsequent **persecution of certain groups**. Authoritarian/totalitarian regimes increasingly target IT systems to identify oppositional movements and minorities for monitoring and persecution. Additional digital tactics include the manipulation of narratives on social media to hinder the communication between the suppressed groups, as well as interventions to frustrate the efforts of the opposition to organise and mobilise.

At the same time, ultra-secure databases for migration and automated monitoring systems are provided in receiving and transit countries. This situation reflects the **digital technology competition between the global superpowers**. Where access to uncensored sources of information is possible, it allows **minorities’ awareness of their rights** and international solidarity. **Strong international civil society organisations** provide networks for minority groups in order to educate minorities on human rights and report human rights violations. 

The geospatially restricted social media landscape enables state-backed misinformation campaigns and societal surveillance, while simultaneously allowing for greater capacities to improve **networking and digital literacy for the suppressed groups and asylum seekers.** Given the capacities for regimes to censor and manipulate messages within their territorialised networks, **decentralised social media and other next generation web applications use blockchain technologies to help migrants and asylum seekers identify legitimate information** on their rights and available resources and to facilitate other aspects of the asylum seeking.

## Remote asylum procedures

The launch of automated immigration processing support systems is intended to control modes of asylum seeking and several countries have mandated **remote asylum application lodging and processing** as the sole mode. Embassies and consulates, using their sovereign territory, are to some extent able to provide safe and secure space and infrastructure for the lodging of asylum applications. Those applications are then sent to the central services of the national asylum authorities, which issue a decision based on the application and interviewing done online.

The **widespread adoption of artificial intelligence-based analytical technologies** – both for asylum application processing and monitoring of asylum seekers’ environments and contextual conditions – facilitates more timely asylum application procedures and helps provide greater in situ safety for migrants. This includes the broad deployment of secure, accurate biometric systems (facial/iris/voice- and gait-recognition) to identify and track both migrants and the individuals in their vicinity.

**Sponsorship programmes** that use remote procedures to pair asylum seekers with hosts successfully operate in some key transit countries. Even though international refugee law remains in force, **many countries** are opting out and are **refusing to host or allow entrance to asylum seekers.** **Bilateral agreements with transit countries addressing refugee support responsibilities and safety measures** are blossoming.

## Innovative solutions to cope with climate change

**Droughts** are more frequent, widespread and longer lasting, adversely affecting crop yields and livelihoods. However, the adoption of **new nutrition sources, new irrigation technologies** and the reduction of food waste are mitigating many of these effects. Insects have become a regular part of human food intake, especially those that thrive in dry areas. Genetically modified food technology, aquaponics and saline farms enable concentrated, **regionally adapted agriculture.** International financial support allows localised rebuilding and resettling to mitigate disaster and climate change-induced displacement. However, the extensive use of new technologies goes hand in hand with the problem that in some regions **educationally disadvantaged people**, in particular, are **left behind** as their home countries modernise.

## Digitally savvy asylum seekers

Extensive international efforts aimed at avoiding regime change and **improving the economic situation in the global South** to stabilise the situation are proving somewhat successful and are to some extent narrowing the economic migration. **Mixed migration has therefore become less diverse with respect to migrants’ countries of origin and educational background.** There is technological competition between the two blocs. In one block, digital platforms that are characterised by state-controlled surveillance. **Digital literacy has become a crucial prerequisite skill** for navigating the international protection procedures.
