# Scenario World Narrative

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/image_blue.jpg" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="This is a figure caption." %}


## Tense but stable geopolitical situation

The tension between the geopolitical blocs has led all sides to seek stabilisation. To maintain the _status quo_, they aim to avoid regime changes and large-scale migration in all parts of the world. 
The support for the economic development in the global South is an important part of this effort and it includes technological as well as financial aid. Many **authoritarian governments** profit from this support. 
They **use new technologies to pacify their populations** by providing cheap food, minor economic development and escape from everyday life via digital entertainment.

##Misuse and benefit of new digital possibilities

In countries of origin, **surveillance technologies** (including the use of social media and mobile telephones) are used by governments to target dissident individuals. "The surveillance state" across several countries allows for more targeted, keyhole identification of dissidents and/or minorities and subsequent **persecution of certain groups**. Authoritarian/totalitarian regimes increasingly target IT systems to identify oppositional movements and minorities for monitoring and persecution. Additional digital tactics include the manipulation of narratives on social media to hinder the communication between the suppressed groups, as well as interventions to frustrate the efforts of the opposition to organise and mobilise.

At the same time, ultra-secure databases for migration and automated monitoring systems are provided in receiving and transit countries. This situation reflects the **digital technology competition between the global superpowers**. Where access to uncensored sources of information is possible, it allows **minoritiesâ€™ awareness of their rights** and international solidarity. **Strong international civil society organisations** provide networks for minority groups in order to educate minorities on human rights and report human rights violations. 

The geospatially restricted social media landscape enables state-backed misinformation campaigns and societal surveillance, while simultaneously allowing for greater capacities to improve **networking and digital literacy for the suppressed groups and asylum seekers.** Given the capacities for regimes to censor and manipulate messages within their territorialised networks, **decentralised social media and other next generation web applications use blockchain technologies to help migrants and asylum seekers identify legitimate information** on their rights and available resources and to facilitate other aspects of the asylum seeking.
