# Scenario World Narrative

## Disruptions to food supply systems triggered by extreme weather events

The effects of climate change and environmental deterioration on human societies have been rapidly getting worse. In addition to sea-level rise and other macro-environmental impacts, more localised effects – in particular extreme weather events (heatwaves, droughts, floods) as well as shifts in rainfall locations – have caused **numerous disruptions to global agriculture and food supply systems.** Declining or collapsing agricultural regions have seen a notable r**ise in regime evictions and state abuse of expropriation practices.** While in some cases food and water scarcity could be mitigated by the adoption of new nutrition sources and reduction of food waste, in most cases the situation leads to forced displacement and loss of livelihood.


## Increasing number of localised conflicts and global wealth inequalities

A global eruption of **localised conflicts and spiralling civil unrest** is observed, with national forces often fighting urban battles against armed and loosely organised protestors. In addition to the disruptions to food and water systems, the **proliferation of inexpensive, 3D-printed firearms** have quickly transformed popular unrest into deadly conflicts. These conditions have, in some territories, rapidly led to the **targeted oppression of minority groups and marginalised segments of society.** While wealthier nations have not escaped these events, they are able to deploy more resources to peaceably settle such situations. However, poorer and deeply indebted nations are unable to provide timely and adequate relief. **Growing global wealth inequalities** have made wealthy nations and regions all the more desirable in the eyes of the displaced. 

## Discrepancy between legal frameworks of international protection and practices

The worldwide number of asylum seekers continues to rise, but previous disagreements between major world economic powers have become **untenable geopolitical fractures** given the increases in systemic disruption and violence. Despite intensified pressures, **attempts at global migration reform have failed** to find agreement. There is a growing divergence between existing agreements and the actual practices applied by states' border security forces, further eroding trust in legal frameworks. In many cases, **countries instrumentalise migrants** to simultaneously alleviate internal pressures and maintain current borders and powers. **Territorial boundaries have become hardened** with infrastructure build-outs (walls and digital monitoring systems), public budgets for enforcement (border patrols, detention centres and deportation systems) are increased and vigilant "border security" is also on the rise. **Widespread discrimination of migrants within local communities** – often manifesting as resource hoarding or outright violence – is neither condoned nor condemned in both transit and destination countries.

## Failed attempt to automate asylum procedures

Initially, some wealthy nations attempted to find technological solutions to the influx of mixed migration. **Attempts were made to create databases using blockchain technologies**, so as to digitalise and automate procedures to differentiate between asylum seekers, economic migrants and other groups massing at borders. However, without a unified agreement on which technologies to use and how to securely deploy these systems, **these technologies were difficult to navigate** for all users (both migrants and caseworkers), **incompatible with one another** and **proved susceptible to different forms of digital attack and corruption.** This only increased frustrations and led many **countries to become more restrictive in their interpretation of international protection**, so as to drastically limit the number of people being granted asylum. Further increasing the difficulties faced by migrants of all kinds, **a more fragmented Internet** became a less reliable source of legitimate information.

## Negative consequences of deregulated social media for asylum seekers

**In many territories, the broader Internet is severely restricted**, making information outside state-sanctioned portals – including official documents on human rights and legal pathways – nearly impossible to access. These issues are only compounded by the **complete deregulation and fast pace of social media** that has occurred **in other regions** – redoubling the amount of **disinformation and exploitation** of desperate asylum seekers on the one hand and **negatively impacting public perception in receiving countries** on the other hand.
