# Automation and Databases
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods can automate identity verification. The databases these technologies rely on are heterogeneous, partial and vulnerable to exploitation.


# A (optimist)
User-controlled private data enables reliable and faster AI-based application processing and environmental monitoring
* Shared guidelines and security measures that are in place and taken up by everyone, exceptionally user-friendly
* Privacy enabled freeware replaces big technology. Data agency is given back to the user - ensuring data privacy and clear consent of data access 
* Organisations which are working in the field can take up database information to facilitate access to the procedure and speed it up (to verify whether someoneâ€™s asylum application has merits).
* Broad deployment of secure, accurate biometric systems (facial / iris / voice- and gait-recognition)


# B (pessimist)
Widespread use of flawed automated systems with suspect databases that have been attacked and exploited by malevolent regimes 
* Malevolent use of digital platforms and databases by third parties / (hostile) countries of origin making refugee returns impossible
* Usages of drones, surveillance tools for coordinating push-backs
* Humanitarian resources are deployed based on imperfect AI algorithms and so crises are made worse
* Totalitarian regimes use biometrics to identify supporters and persecute dissidents
* Identifying databases used as bargaining chip for international negotiations
* Individuals have no control over the data collected and stored by developers and monitoring entities.
* Databases increasingly controlled by the private sector, who are not democratically elected and not open about how data are collected or used


# C1 (mediator)
* AI has been implemented extensively, and is working well across various international protection activities and procedures
* Private and Public databases are used by automated systems for a variety of governmental tasks. 
* Data privacy policies are ineffective at safe guarding personally identifiable information.
* Biometric genetics are used to estimate relatedness in support of family reunification (security concerns emerge)

# C2 (mediator)
The application of AI automated systems is hindered by restricting use to limited, secure databases 
* Databases do not include all information, so malevolent actors who manage to get access, cannot harm migrants to the same extent 
* Biometrics are used to identify asylum seekers and create efficiency gains in management of populations in need

# D (innovator)
Fully automated asylum processes that involve no human intervention  
* AI-based admin systems allow making quick decisions on asylum applications thus solving the problem of backlog and allowing more people to get international protection
* No human intervention needed in the processing of asylum claims
* Persistent gaps in ability to conduct audits or performance reviews of AI/ML systems due to limited knowledge of decision-making algorithms.
