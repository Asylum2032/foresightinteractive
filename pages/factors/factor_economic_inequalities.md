# Economic Inequalities
# A (Optimist)
Global initiatives and rapid economic development reduce mixed migration
* Indebted countries have loans forgiven (China) allowing them to reinvest in society
* Reduced wealth inequalities in third countries: better living standards, abated poverty, wide-spread access to healthcare
* Further economic development makes third countries more attractive, diverting some mixed migration towards those regions
* Global initiative - collaboration between governments - make it compulsory for large corporations to donate a part of their profit to maintenance/financial support for refugee camps around the world
  &rarr; This in turn improves living conditions in refugee camps around the world, reducing the incentive to move onward


# B (Pessimist)
Inequalities worsen living conditions and create more migrants and increase the misuse of international protection 
* Widening wealth disparities exacerbate poor living conditions for those in need of protection
* Increased motivation to migrate illegally
* Increased social injustice
* Heightened trade barriers and abandonment of free trade (exit of large economic powers)
* Weaker nations bearing burden of weaker international trade


# C1 (Mediator)
Increased development triggers greater number of migrants 
* Increased economic development leads to increases of migrant outflows
* These outflows are compounded by fore-seen demographic changes
* Global Tax initiatives fund successful eco-nomic development projects.


# C2 (Mediator)
Wealth inequalities are unevenly addressed, reduced inflows to wealthy nations
* Wealth inequalities are unevenly addressed with rich nations reducing internal wealth gaps
* Poorer nations are unable to draw closer to rich nations, and deal with increasing internal wealth disparities
* Mixed migration becomes less diverse as poorer people are unable to begin migration journey
* Redistribution of resources across rich and poor countries leads to reduced inflows to more wealthy countries


# D (Innovator)
Technologies reduce inequalities: AI, telework, renewable energy 
* Artificial intelligence (AI) development guides resource and wealth distribution efforts under a new human/political compromise 
* Wider acceptance of teleworking enables greater outsourcing, more job opportunities, and reduced economic strains
* Global push for sustainable energy
* Technologies - crypto currency, remote services - make populations less dependent on national economy
