# Social Media

# A (Optimist)
Regulated, mediated and trustworthy social media provide reliable information while respecting privacy by default
* Migrants can inform and educate themselves in their surroundings (environment, context, culture), which leads to a bottom-up transformation towards more equality in society 
* Using social media to make up for missed professional education (during transit, or due to conflict) is possible (in conjunction with Massive Open Online Courses)
* Successful social media campaigns, policies, and technologies to dismantle fake news, curtail hate speech, and remove fake accounts used to seed discontent. 
* Social media fall under new standards and regulations. These regulations put ethical concerns ahead of profitability

# B (Pessimist)
Completely deregulated social media increases extremism, criminal exploitation, and enables government oppression
* Criminal networks continue to use social media to organise and conduct migrant-smuggling activities, including smuggling of asylum seekers
* Information shared on social media is harnessed by national authorities to identify minority, vulnerable groups, and repress freedom of expression
* Increased dependency on social media by third-country nationals allows increased oppression by governments
* Social media is linked to a global increase of minority persecution 
* Social media further funnel users to (religious) extremism and eventually to acts of terrorism


# C1 (Mediator)
Social media follow international regulation on minimal standards to limit misinformation and damaging content 
* Databases on asylum seekers remain non-uniform and inaccurate, introducing bias and mistakes to the processes of international protection
* Under societal pressure, social media platforms dramatically improve the self-regulation of damaging content
* Successful campaigns by "unsuccessful refugees" to discourage further dangerous journeys by fellow citizens in third countries


# C2 (Mediator)
Geospatially restricted social media landscape further limits access to information, and enables censorship and surveillance
* Unregulated social media are harnessed to track and anticipate migratory flows, enabling receiving nations to better prepare for increases of refugees.
* Social mediaâ€™s use of biased analytics methods and incomplete databases create or enhance inaccuracies in the processing of international protection claims
* Intra-platform competition puts ethical corporate behaviour at odds with profitability
* Social media are no longer used by both agencies and asylum seeking migrants given known problems in database accuracy, and data authenticity.  


# D (Innovator)
New technologies enable deeper integration of next generation communications
* 'Metaverse' social technologies provide safe and secure virtual spaces for oppressed social groups 
* Virtual worlds increase employment opportunities that can be performed nearly anywhere.
* Virtual spaces effectively blur the line between physical and digital for social and cultural life.
