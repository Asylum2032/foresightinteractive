# Transit Countries Roles

Transit nations serve as a mode of containment, hold the possibility for 
increased externalisation and might instrumentalise asylum-seeking migrants.


## A (Optimist)

Equitable agreements ease border pressure and improve conditions
* Transit countries enhance human rights protection
* Transit countries improve their integration policies 
* Improved living conditions in transit countries
* Some countries pursue asylum legislation and integration standards on a voluntary basis
* Regional solutions in nations or areas of immigrant origin decrease overall pressure on transit countries

## B (Pessimist)

Instrumentalised immigrants, disintegrating political dialogue, increasing 
abuses and worsening conditions
* Neighbouring countries use asylum seekers to demand more resources to continue containment efforts
* The use of immigrants in hybrid warfare tactics becomes common place
* Abuse of visa-free regimes
* Increasing nationalism among transit country citizens, and further radicalisation of immigrants in transit countries with closed borders
* Transit countries abandoning of EU accession process / decreased willingness to align with EU asylum standards on a voluntary basis


## C1 (Mediator)

Protected transit corridors assure asylum seekers safety of movement 
* International organizations successfully operate protected transit corridors with some/key transit countries
* Special partnership agreements are developed with key transit countries, but are costly and do not work equally well

## C2 (Mediator)

Broad adoption of remote asylum application processing de-incentivises improving international agreements or conditions
* Asylum claim processing for migrants located in transit countries (remote processing)
* Blossoming of bilateral agreements/statements (pushing problem on other countries, status quo extended)

## D (Innovator)

Developed transit country labour markets and expanded refugee sponsorship programmes
* Improved economic and political stability of transit countries through labour market development.
* Sponsorship programmes use remote processing to pair refugees with hosts
