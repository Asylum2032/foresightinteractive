# Transit Countries Roles

Transit nations serve as a mode of containment, hold the possibility for 
increased externalisation and might instrumentalise asylum-seeking migrants.

## A (Optimist)

Equitable agreements ease border pressure and improve conditions

## C1 (Mediator)

Protected transit corridors assure asylum seekers safety of movement 

## C2 (Mediator)

Broad adoption of remote asylum application processing de-incentivises  
improving international agreements or conditions

## B (Pessimist)

Instrumentalised immigrants, disintegrating political dialogue, increasing 
abuses and worsening conditions

## D (Innovator)

Developed transit country labour markets and expanded refugee sponsorship programmes
