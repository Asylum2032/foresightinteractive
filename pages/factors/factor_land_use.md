# Regime protection, state violence and disputed changes in land use
Regimes controlling wealth generated from exploitation of resources may exercise violent protection against any threats to power.

|

# A (Optimist)
More transparency, more international awareness hinder misuse of state power and land grabbing
* Easily accessible technologies (like YouTube) are used effectively to document state violence and raise awareness of the oppression, in turn increasing domestic and international pressure on the regime 
* Climate change fosters a discussion about how land and its use is intrinsically connected to people's identity and well-being; international regulations follow which reduce the land grabbing conflict induced migration
* Western states, under pressure from an increasing number of authoritarian ones, seriously collaborate to set and enforce consequences on state leaders and their business interests for any human rights violations.

# B (Pessimist)
Regime evictions become more frequent and geographically widespread
* International channels for journalism and reporting are controlled, so there is no global public left to watch state violence; the state 'cleanses' its population to only leave those who agree to a given regime
* Eviction orders becoming the regular and widespread regime behaviour 
* Bitcoins open up new ways of money laundering and bribing, so that regimes become more effective at buying continued support


# C1 (Mediator)
Democracies on the rise lead to lower level of regime violence
* After the wave of de-democratisation eases off, another wave of democratisation - with associated lower levels of regime protection violence - takes place reducing regime violence-led migration 
* In many autocratically ruled countries in Africa, economic expansion vastly enlarges a middle class which manages to secure more democratic rights

# C2 (Mediator)
State violence and land grabbing are intensified by climate change
* In the wake of adaptation to climate challenges, regimes put more emphasis on cooperation and hence pursue more mitigating (than profit increasing or self-protecting) policies
* Evictions of minority groups and political opposition continue to take place (to reward those who favoured the regime)
* Targeted state violence increases in frequency, though it is highly focused

# D (Innovator)
Technology reduces resource scarcity and helps safeguard ethno-minorities
* Less dependency on land, so less conflict on disputed land
* Technology monitoring oppression in various countries and mechanism allowing certain individuals to seek international protection if they are oppressed and vulnerable.
