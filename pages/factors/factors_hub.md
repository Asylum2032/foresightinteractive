factors_a:
  - title: "Armed Conflict"
    excerpt: "Interstate conflicts, military interventions, terrorism and civil war create conditions for affected populations to engage in asylum-seeking migration. In some areas these situations, or the risk thereof, are increasing."

  - title: "Food & Water Insecurity"

  - title: "Legal Pathways to International Protection"
    excerpt: "The options through which international protection can be legally pursued may change based on reforms to global agreements, national level legisla-tion, in conjunction with technologies that enable new processes and operations."

To develop coherent and useful alternative future scenarios, it is first necessary to gather, organise, and assess 
information about key factors that are influencing the development of international protection and asylum-related 
migration. We use the term factor to encompass trends, emerging issues and novel developments (i.e. social phenomena or 
technology uses) that drive or shape changes related to international protection in the future. Research activities 
included a literature review and expert interviews with EUAA staff, and resulted in an organised collection of initial 
factors for use in the workshop process.
