# Climate Change Induced Displacement
Changing environmental conditions lead to justification for permanent displaced populations. Powerful entity takes control of land, displaces previous users, enforces new ownership and management with violent oppression.

# A (Optimist)
Climate refugees protected by IP policy and environmental policy reduces impacts
* Refugee and asylum legislation expanded to include climate-induced displacement, allowing people to get a recognised status, no qualification limbo for applicants 
* Technologically protecting people from the effects of natural disasters (e.g. predictions of flood levels, droughts etc.), mitigation policy and pre-emptive operations reduce impacts
* International land ownership rights are strengthened / expanded (e.g. include indigenous groups etc.) giving peo-ple the tools to dispute expropriation
* Community sponsorships, work and visa programmes related to certain skills and regions are created

# B (Pessimist)
Intensification of climate impacts increases displacement, insecurity and migrants seeking international protection
* Climate change intensifies permanent desertification of areas and armed conflicts
* The number of extreme weather events increases globally, impacting developing countries disproportionally, and leading to an increased number of vulnerable, internally and internationally displaced people, in precarious situations
* Climate-induced migration policy is not addressed, migrants receive no formal legal status, and are not able to return to COI
* Policy changes, conflict and economic interest lead to forced changes in land use, increase in “unsuccessful” asylum seekers, as internal displacement is not acknowledged criteria
* People suffer persecution and human rights violations during migration journey after land disputes

# C1 (Mediator)
Financial support and land ownership policy allows localised rebuilding and resettling
* More money is invested in preventing climate-induced displacement such as disaster risk reduction etc. allowing affected population to deal with the events more successfully &rarr; and thus being less likely to have to move
* Land ownership rights are somewhat clarified in some regions and fewer people are forced to leave their homeland

# C2 (Mediator)
Unchanged rate of climate induced migration, weak enforcement and protections of land rights 
* Gradual increase in climate disasters leads to slowly increased migration flows
* In some areas the actors that enforce the changes in land use resort to military forces
* Land ownership rights are formally strengthened but cannot be successfully enforced due to widespread corruption, other issues, leading to very little change in terms of displacement


# D (Innovator)
Technological solutions to climate extremes, supplemented by experience-based migrant matching 
* Technological developments allow people to live and survive in extreme conditions
* Alternative assessment instruments/criteria for asylum could be more inclusive, e.g. economically
* Creation programmes where refugees, who were previously farmers/had land, have an opportunity to work in rural areas in farming, agriculture, and so on in EU+ countries, where we have been witnessing a rural exodus for decades
