Interstate conflicts, military interventions, terrorism and civil war create 
conditions for affected populations to engage in asylum-seeking migration. In 
some areas these situations, or the risk thereof, are increasing.

# A (optimist)

Transparency, participation, social cohesion lead to fewer conflicts on a national and international level

* More democratic and less corrupt political movements gain the upper hand because of increased transparency 
* Driving forces of armed con-flicts (e.g. resource scarcity) are less relevant because of new technology
* Education and access to in-formation increase under-standing
* International peace organisa-tions help reduce armed con-flicts
* Conflicting interests resolved within international and re-gional fora
