Interstate conflicts, military interventions, terrorism and civil war create 
conditions for affected populations to engage in asylum-seeking migration. In 
some areas these situations, or the risk thereof, are increasing.

# A (optimist)

Transparency, participation, social cohesion lead to fewer conflicts on a national and international level

* More democratic and less corrupt political movements gain the upper hand because of increased transparency 
* Driving forces of armed conflicts (e.g. resource scarcity) are less relevant because of new technology
* Education and access to information increase understanding
* International peace organisations help reduce armed conflicts
* Conflicting interests resolved within international and regional fora


# B1 (pessimist)
Changes in the world order lead to large scale international war

* Superpower expansionism meets armed resistance, incites international conflict, or
* Global superpowers are drawn into an extraterritorial war (like Vietnam), which leads to large-scale refugee flows


# B2 (pessimist)
Unlimited availability of weapons and resource scarcity culminate in several limited armed conflicts
* Armed conflicts between communities become more frequent due to decreasing resources
* Online technology supports the recruitment of people for armed conflicts
* More weapons are available, with higher destructive power 
* Using 3D printers, everyone can download weapons and political disagreements quickly reach the brink of civil war


# C1 (mediator)
Successful search for peaceful solutions (e.g. through education and mediation) on an international level
* Information and education promoting better life opportunities are able to convince people  in some geographical areas to abandon armed conflicts
* International community accepts the responsibility of conflicts due to vestiges of colonial history and international mediation is successful in finding solutions in some areas
* International community establishes surveillance mechanisms over conflict-prone countries (oil producers)


# C2 (mediator)
Freeze - panem et circenses on the national level and 'cold war' on an international level lead to a stable situation
* "Bread and games" neutralises political attention and will of populations , even autocratic regimes manage to establish a stable situation
* A new cold war be-tween the global superpowers makes both bent on the status quo, so that they put pressure on many countries to avoid regime change 


# D (innovator) 
Civic technologies reinvent national level democracy and increase stability
* Technology innovations contribute to foster a democratisation process and institutional transformations
* International community puts a strict control over supply of weapons/networks that are engaged in that
* Transparency reduces corruption to a large extent
* Participation reaches a new level (civic technology)
