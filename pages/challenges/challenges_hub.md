While outlining challenges for any given scenario is a useful exercise, the strategic purpose of the scenario development process is to help an organisation prepare for a wide spectrum of possible futures. Identifying critical challenges present across the scenarios helps to prioritise as well as build preparedness and resilience. This section outlines those challenges that play a role across all of the scenarios within three categories: 1) Geopolitics and International Relations, 2) Digitalisation and Data, and 3) Climate Change and Resources. To better develop an anticipatory stance for uncertain futures, and create a more robust institution, the following should be integrated into organisational strategic planning activities. 

# Challenge Cluster 1: Geopolitics and International Relations

This cluster is focused on challenges that can emerge if relationships between countries shift, global alliances reconfigure themselves, and the rules governing those relationships change accordingly. The scenarios address very distinct geopolitical situations and outline the very different challenges each presents within the scope of international protection. Armed conflicts, be they at the international scale or limited to national or regional civil wars, are one of the greatest concerns with regard to the futures of international protection given the variety of challenges such conflicts present. The distinct possibility of widespread increase in armed conflict is explicitly taken up in one scenario (Caimans and Piranhas).

Transit countries, and differing strategies to building relationships with them, remain a source of challenges across all scenarios. The scenarios show that different forms of cooperation and support for international protection are possible, but challenges arise from political instabilities and their sensitivity to external disruptions. Two scenarios explore economic development in transit countries and the new challenges that emerge (e.g. corruption and exploitation of refugees and migrants). A resilient and longer-term orientation of international protection activities should therefore include close cooperation with strategically selected transit countries, this might also include a strategic monitoring of transit countries. Further challenges arise as international protection applicants live in transit countries for increasingly longer durations, and the possibility of introducing of international protection quotas or other attempts to limit the number of refugees are attempted, as addressed in different scenarios.

**Noted challenges**

* At the level of international organisations, there remains the possibility that long standing organisations (like the United Nations or the World Trade Organization) will be asked or forced to change some of the underlying legal agreements that bind them. In particular, shifts to the conventions regarding international protection and the possibility of it being revised to include ‘climate refugees’, presented a number of challenges.  
* Additionally, the economic development of present day ‘transit countries’ was viewed as a mode of reconfiguring international relationships more specific to migration and refugees. However, this was often linked to amplifying challenges of corruption and exploitation and adding complexity to specific state agreements.
* Armed conflict remains a primary challenge area for international protection, as any increase in violence (state-to-state, civil conflict, etc.) can increase the number of international protection applicants. While three scenarios look at a world with decreased state-to-state conflict, two of these scenarios describe a rise in surveillance and persecution of groups and the possibility of civil unrest. For the scenario that shows an uptick in armed conflict, the challenges for international protection multiply more rapidly.

# Challenge Cluster 2: Digitalisation and Data

As digitalisation continues to reshape many aspects of daily life and work, it presents some distinct challenges within the context of international protection. Scenarios examined how digital technologies offer improvements to speed of information transfer, remote work, data processing and analysis, and other efficiencies, alongside the new challenges they present. Major challenge areas include a rapidly changing technological landscape, scarce and expensive human resources, inconsistent database quality, non-standardised interoperability, an uncertain regulatory environment and increasing cybersecurity risks. The various implementations of Artificial Intelligence, the quality of data is relies on, and different regulatory environments, are important challenges examined across all scenarios. Furthermore, defining the boundaries between automated support systems and human decision-making is a critical challenge that is partially determined by data reliability and regulatory environment.

Global differentiation of data standards, platforms, social media and the increasing fragmentation of the internet are challenge areas considered across numerous scenarios. These are accompanied by increasing use of surveillance technologies - by different types of actors and for different purposes - befitting scenario conditions. A resilient digital strategy in the area of international protection requires observation of these developments and the build-up of competences for different “digital spheres”. Additionally, an increasing digital divide among refugees, and discrimination against asylum seekers based on these differences is a challenge requiring explicit consideration by international protection agencies.

**Noted Challenges** 

* Ensuring that the international protection institutions can develop the knowledge, skills and capacities needed to continue progress on digitalisation given limited budgets and a rapidly developing technological landscape. 
* The rapidly changing technological landscape makes it difficult to identify the best technology for any given task, that is durable and adaptable so as to maintain viability over a time horizon that justifies expenditures.
* It demands continuous (often expensive) training and skills acquisition by the workforce.
* It creates competing standards that can negatively impact interoperability, database reliability and broader adoption by partners or collaborators
* Artificial Intelligence systems and technologies require highly specialised skills to program, test and validate. Given the popularity of artificial intelligence, these human resources can be difficult and expensive to retain.
* Effective automated systems require large databases of highly structured and verified data to ‘train’ on as well as databases with non-uniform structures. Incomplete or misconfigured entries can introduce various types of bias. 
* Increased reliance on digital network technologies leaves essential workplaces and processes at risk of facing increased cybersecurity threats. This is a global phenomenon, with cyberattacks being both state-sponsored and criminal initiatives.

# Challenge Cluster 3: Climate Change and Resources

![image-right](/foresightinteractive/assets/images/ClimateChangeResources.jpg){: .align-right }
The continuation of climate change creates a number of challenges for international protection, even in scenarios in which human societies are taking proactive measure to limit global warming and mitigate climate change effects.

In particular, the collapse of food supply chains due to climate crises and extreme weather events poses a major challenge for international protection. Several scenarios describe the refugee flows directly caused by these events as well as the migration movements due to violent conflicts in connection with the shortage of food supplies. Under these conditions, it is hardly possible to distinguish between reasons for flight covered by international protection and economic reasons, that are not included. 

Within the framework of the scenario process, it was disputed whether there could be a legal recognition of climate refugees within the framework of international protection within the next 10 years. Such a fundamental change would be accompanied by considerable challenges for the respective authorities, as the recognition criteria would have to be redefined and, if necessary, coordinated internationally. In addition, the number of applicants on this basis could rise very sharply in the coming years.

**Noted Challenges**
* Shifting rainfall patterns, extreme weather events, and other climate change effects can cause population displacement at varying scales. While some of this displacement may be temporary, displaced communities will still increase strain on resources and infrastructure where they settle. These increased pressures can eventually lead to targeted persecution and can create new sources of international protection applicants. 
* Disruptions from climate change, as outlined above, can also destabilise socio-political conditions, leading to the rise of more oppressive regimes which can carry out targeted persecution. Again, this model also increases the number of asylum seekers.  
* Climate change can disrupt food and water supplies, effecting any populations that are reliant on delivery systems (i.e. global markets and logistics) of these essential resources. In this manner, climate-change induced disruptions can have far reaching socio-political impacts on peoples and communities, and again lead to more authoritarian and oppressive governance regimes which use land eviction and resource expropriation to consolidate power.
