While outlining challenges for any given scenario is a useful exercise, the strategic purpose of the scenario development process is to help an organisation prepare for a wide spectrum of possible futures. Identifying critical challenges present across the scenarios helps to prioritise as well as build preparedness and resilience. This section outlines those challenges that play a role across all of the scenarios within three categories: 1) Geopolitics and International Relations, 2) Digitalisation and Data, and 3) Climate Change and Resources. To better develop an anticipatory stance for uncertain futures, and create a more robust institution, the following should be integrated into organisational strategic planning activities. 

# Challenge Cluster 1: Geopolitics and International Relations 

This cluster is focused on challenges that can emerge if relationships between countries shift and reconfigure themselves, and the rules governing those relationships change accordingly. The scenarios address very distinct geopolitical situations and outline the very different challenges each presents within the scope of international protection. 

Armed conflicts, be they at the international scale or limited to national or regional civil wars, are one of the greatest concerns with regard to the futures of international protection given the variety of challenges such conflicts present. The distinct possibility of widespread increase in armed conflict is explicitly taken up in one scenario (Caimans and Piranhas), while the threat of smaller scale armed conflict, particularly in transit countries, and the steps taken to avoid such incidents is explored in the others.   

Transit countries and differing strategies to building relationships with them remain a source of challenges across all scenarios. Close cooperation with transit countries could become particularly important if these countries take over parts of the processing of applications. The scenarios show that different forms of cooperation are possible, ranging from actual on-site processing in these countries to remote application support through the provision of digital infrastructures. Further challenges arise from the political instabilities in many transit countries, and the very real threat that major disruptions (e.g. extreme weather, economic disruption, resource scarcity, etc.) can quickly destabilise socio-political systems in transit countries.

While two scenarios explore economic development in transit countries as a mode of strengthening their economies and changing the role that they play in international protection, these ‘solutions’ also carry new challenges (e.g. corruption and exploitation of refugees and migrants). In the course of the scenario process, the extent to which economic support for transit countries could lead to these countries changing from transit countries to host countries and thus assuming even greater importance in the context of international protection was disputed. 

Even in the case of stabilised geopolitical blocs, transit countries take on important strategic roles in maintaining the stability by serving as migration channels or buffer zones to keep the peace between blocs. A resilient and longer-term orientation of international protection activities should therefore include close cooperation with strategically selected transit countries, this might also include a strategic monitoring of transit countries. Furthermore, challenges arise as international protection applicants live in transit countries for increasingly longer durations. Safeguarding their lives, providing material support for their daily needs and developing routes for safe transit are costs that must be born, and can be at the root of bi-lateral or multi-lateral agreements. The introduction of international protection quotas is a very specific challenge and the limitation of the number of refugees has been discussed in the context of different scenarios. 

**Noted challenges**

* At the level of international organisations, there remains the possibility that long standing organisations (like the United Nations or the World Trade Organization) will be asked or forced to change some of the underlying legal agreements that bind them. In particular, shifts to the conventions regarding international protection and the possibility of it being revised to include ‘climate refugees’, presented a number of challenges.  
* Additionally, the economic development of present day ‘transit countries’ was viewed as a mode of reconfiguring international relationships more specific to migration and refugees. However, this was often linked to amplifying challenges of corruption and exploitation and adding complexity to specific state agreements.
* Armed conflict remains a primary challenge area for international protection, as any increase in violence (state-to-state, civil conflict, etc.) can increase the number of international protection applicants. While three scenarios look at a world with decreased state-to-state conflict, two of these scenarios describe a rise in surveillance and persecution of groups and the possibility of civil unrest. For the scenario that shows an uptick in armed conflict, the challenges for international protection multiply more rapidly.

# Challenge Cluster 2: Digitalisation and Data

As digital technologies continue to reshape many aspects of daily life and work, they present some distinct challenges within the context of international protection. While digital technologies offer improvements to speed information transfer, remote work, data processing and analysis, and other efficiencies, they also present new challenges. Major challenge areas include a rapidly changing technological landscape, scarce and expensive human resources, inconsistent database quality, non-standardised interoperability, an uncertain regulatory environment and increasing cybersecurity risks.

The internationally coordinated use of transparent and explainable artificial intelligence for increasingly automated processing of applications, represents a particularly important challenge across numerous different scenarios. The reliability of the available data varies greatly across the scenarios and being able to evaluate the data quality accurately for different regions and at different points in time will be one of the major challenges in the future.

Across several scenarios, it was repeatedly emphasised that final decisions should still be made or at least supervised by a human being and only be supported by artificial intelligence. Hence, the challenge will be to clearly define which aspects can be largely handled unsupervised by artificial intelligence and which aspects are deliberately assigned to human beings. 

A possible geopolitical division into different blocs or spheres of influence – each with different data standards, platforms and social media – is accompanied by special challenges for international protections. These challenges should be considered from a long-term, strategic orientation, since variants of this increasing fragmentation of the internet (e.g. the splinternet) are considered across numerous scenarios. A resilient digital strategy in the area of international protection therefore requires the early observation of this development and the build-up of competences for different "digital spheres". 

The increasing use of surveillance technologies is included in all of the scenarios, though it plays different roles in each. For example, one scenario presents surveillance used to protect and inform refugees and migrants, while another outlines increasing use of state surveillance to monitor and persecute dissidents and minorities. In any construal, the expansion of surveillance entails that international protection authorities build up extensive expertise in this area.

A major challenge for international protection is the risk of an increasing digital divide among refugees. Discrimination against asylum seekers with lower digital skills is a challenge that is discussed across the scenarios and will require explicit consideration in the design of future processing procedures by the international protection agencies, to ensure that these effects are not extremely amplified by increasing automation and the use of remote applications.  

**Noted Challenges** 

* Ensuring that the international protection institutions can develop the knowledge, skills and capacities needed to continue progress on digitalisation given limited budgets and a rapidly developing technological landscape. 
* The rapidly changing technological landscape makes it difficult to identify the best technology for any given task, that is durable and adaptable so as to maintain viability over a time horizon that justifies expenditures.
* It demands continuous (often expensive) training and skills acquisition by the workforce.
* It creates competing standards that can negatively impact interoperability, database reliability and broader adoption by partners or collaborators
* Artificial Intelligence systems and technologies require highly specialised skills to program, test and validate. Given the popularity of artificial intelligence, these human resources can be difficult and expensive to retain.
* Effective automated systems require large databases of highly structured and verified data to ‘train’ on as well as databases with non-uniform structures. Incomplete or misconfigured entries can introduce various types of bias. 
* Increased reliance on digital network technologies leaves essential workplaces and processes at risk of facing increased cybersecurity threats. This is a global phenomenon, with cyberattacks being both state-sponsored and criminal initiatives.

# Challenge Cluster 3: Climate Change and Resources

The continuation of climate change creates a number of challenges for international protection, even in scenarios in which human societies are taking proactive measure to limit global warming and mitigate climate change effects.

In particular, the collapse of food supply chains due to climate crises and extreme weather events poses a major challenge for international protection. Several scenarios describe the refugee flows directly caused by these events as well as the migration movements due to violent conflicts in connection with the shortage of food supplies. Under these conditions, it is hardly possible to distinguish between reasons for flight covered by international protection and economic reasons, that are not included. 

Within the framework of the scenario process, it was disputed whether there could be a legal recognition of climate refugees within the framework of international protection within the next 10 years. Such a fundamental change would be accompanied by considerable challenges for the respective authorities, as the recognition criteria would have to be redefined and, if necessary, coordinated internationally. In addition, the number of applicants on this basis could rise very sharply in the coming years.

**Noted Challenges**
* Shifting rainfall patterns, extreme weather events, and other climate change effects can cause population displacement at varying scales. While some of this displacement may be temporary, displaced communities will still increase strain on resources and infrastructure where they settle. These increased pressures can eventually lead to targeted persecution and can create new sources of international protection applicants. 
* Disruptions from climate change, as outlined above, can also destabilise socio-political conditions, leading to the rise of more oppressive regimes which can carry out targeted persecution. Again, this model also increases the number of asylum seekers.  
* Climate change can disrupt food and water supplies, effecting any populations that are reliant on delivery systems (i.e. global markets and logistics) of these essential resources. In this manner, climate-change induced disruptions can have far reaching socio-political impacts on peoples and communities, and again lead to more authoritarian and oppressive governance regimes which use land eviction and resource expropriation to consolidate power.
