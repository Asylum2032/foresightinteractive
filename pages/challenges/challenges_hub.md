While outlining challenges for any given scenario is a useful exercise, the strategic purpose of the scenario development process is to help an organisation prepare for a wide spectrum of possible futures. Identifying critical challenges present across the scenarios helps to prioritise as well as build preparedness and resilience. This section outlines those challenges that play a role across all of the scenarios within three categories: 1) Geopolitics and International Relations, 2) Digitalisation and Datafication, and 3) Climate Change and Resource Scarcity.
