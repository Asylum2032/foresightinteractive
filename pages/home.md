There exists no singular future that we are capable of knowing. As such, the practice of strategic foresight acknowledges that preparing for a variety of futures means creating a sense of familiarity with the scope of future possibilities. This project aims to provide the EUAA and its partners with future-oriented assets and skills to better prepare for and fulfil their mission within a dynamic, rapidly changing world. Through this project’s multiple phases, teams from the EUAA, national asylum authorities and Fraunhofer ISI created a set of coherent future scenarios – narratives that enable policy and decision makers to better perceive and respond to the complexity and uncertainty of possible futures.

The scenario development process began with the identification of a number of factors that were both external to the EU+ countries and driving change in international protection. Over the course of three workshops with EUAA staff, representatives of national asylum authorities and partner EU institutions, these fundamental factors became the foundation for scenario writing and analysis activities. The participatory scenario process was designed to accommodate the diversity of the workshop attendees, and help them articulate pre-existing ideas they associated with the future developments and impacts of each factor. This enabled participants to robustly define the boundaries of each factor’s option space for development in the future, and simultaneously encouraged participants to identify taboo topics and other type of cognitive bias that were at play when discussing the futures of international protection. This multi-workshop process yielded four unique and viable future scenario narratives with corresponding personas that support immersion into each scenario world, and results of the indepth analysis.

The scenario analysis focused on both an expert based Delphi survey and interactive workshop to identify critical challenges. The Delphi-style survey helped gather quantitative and qualitative expert feedback into the likelihood and anticipated time-horizon for critical aspects of each scenario. The identified challenges focused on scenario-specific implications for international protection actors, and on modes of building institutional resilience by addressing challenges common across multiple scenarios.

Identifying critical future challenges facing actors and institutions in the field of international protection was a central goal of this strategic foresight project. In examining both the challenges presented by the individual scenarios, and the collective challenges of all scenarios combined, we were able to identify three key areas for anticipatory action. Firstly, 
**_geopolitical tensions and international relations_**  was identified as one key challenge area for international protection institutes to monitor and integrate into preparedness activities and strategic planning. Being prepared for the ramifications of armed conflict at different scales is a chief challenge, given the rapidity with which conflict can emerge and escalate. Additionally, the changing relationships between traditional destination and countries in the route between these and the countries of origin (i.e. economic development and funding programmes in these countries) effects expectations for all stakeholders in international protection. Finally, destabilisation of and disagreement within longstanding international governance organisations can radically complicate the international protection convention and how it is interpreted.

At the same time, rapid technological developments in **_Digitalisation and Data_** often appear to harbour opportunities for efficiency gains in arenas like the processing of international protection applications, remote interviews, translation assistants, and decision support with artificial intelligence (AI). However, there are strong challenges for the adoption of such technologies. The development of cross institutional standards or protocols, and ensuring their being adhered to creates new burdens, and may require expertise and skills that are not currently available. Furthermore, safeguarding data integrity and cyber security are just two instances of challenges that new technological deployment engenders.

Lastly, a number of challenges arise with intensifying effects of _**Climate Change and Resources**_ become scarcer or unreliably available. While current international interpretation does not include ‘climate refugees’, changing weather patterns can alter traditional regional agricultural capacities through drought, desertification, flooding, and extreme weather events. While some of these effects may be temporary, displaced populations will strain resources in the regions where they land, and over longer time frames this sets the stage for socio-political disruptions that can create asylum-seekers. As we have recently seen, disruptions to global supply chains including new restrictions, geopolitical tensions, and damages to infrastructure can also set up conditions for the emergence of new international protection applicants. 
While some of these challenge areas are outside of the control of institutions like the EUAA, taken individually or together, the scenarios and accompanying analysis outline specific challenges that organisations can begin to prepare for in terms of, for example, staff, training, strategic plans, building robust networks, and policy adjustments. Taking uncertainties and interdependencies into account, each scenario notably specifies how factors have evolved and effected change to international protection systems. In presenting these scenarios here, the project partners offer some productive insights into the possible futures for international protection, and a set of scenarios that enables stakeholders to better prepare themselves to achieve their missions going forward.
