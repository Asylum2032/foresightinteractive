    title: "Humming Bees on the Global Meadows"
    excerpt: "By 2032, the number and intensity of armed conflicts have decreased. Economic development in countries of origin and transit countries  can be observed. Human rights, and minority rights in particular, are increasingly recognised globally. Increasing environmental awareness and the use of technology to protect people from the effects of natural disasters are accompanied by successful court cases regarding the recognition of climate change-induced displacement. Asylum application processes are digitalised to a large extent and make use of the improved data provision of digital networks and platforms."

    title: "Circling Sharks and Orcas"
    excerpt: "By 2032, a new cold war between the global superpowers makes them determined to maintain the status quo. The threat of a large-scale armed conflict is omnipresent and dominates the action. The global superpowers put pressure on countries to avoid regime change and provide support for regional solutions mitigating the climate change effects. Many authoritarian governments use new technologies for surveillance purposes and to pacify their populations. The asylum application processes have become largely automatised and remote application processes are mainly initiated in transit countries since territorialisation is hardened."

    title: "Sleeping Leopard in a Paper Cage"
    excerpt: "By 2032, Global power centres have unofficially divided the world into spheres of influence and increasingly acknowledge the special importance of transit countries for maintaining boundaries. Economic development in transit countries is therefore supported by major power blocs with a focus on developing job opportunities and the living conditions of migrants in these countries. The relationship between people, their data and social institutions has shifted with the aim to give individuals control over their personal data. This development enhances the possibilities of data use in remote asylum application processing, but flawed algorithms and systemic exploits remain problematic. The increasing threat to livelihoods due to climate change remains unresolved."

    title: "Caimans and Piranhas in a Drying Pond"
    excerpt: "By 2032, Numerous disruptions to global agriculture and food supply systems caused by the effects of climate change have led to conflicts and spiralling civil unrest in the global South. Territorial boundaries have become hardened with infrastructure build-outs. There is a discrepancy between the legal frameworks of international protection and actual practices applied at the state borders. The failed attempt to automate asylum application processes goes back to unreliable databases and leads to a more restrictive interpretation of international protection in many countries. Asylum seekers are negatively affected by unregulated social media."

The scenario development process began with the identification of a number of 
factors that were both external to the EU+ countries and driving change in 
international protection. Based on them, the process of scenario development 
followed during three workshops with EUAA staff, representatives of national 
asylum authorities and partner EU institutions. At the end of a multi-workshop 
scenario development process, four unique and viable future scenarios were 
refined in preparation for the scenario analysis process. Each of these scenarios 
centres around three of the most impactful and uncertain factors and details how 
developments among those key factors infer coinciding and coherent developments 
in the other factors.

Given the explicit focus of the project to identify and analyse the potential 
development of factors influencing the future of international protection that 
are external to the EU (Annex 2a), the scenario worlds are presented as 
descriptive narratives of global changes. Where appropriate, the scenarios 
attempt to explain how each of the central factors has influenced the world at 
large and what changes the EUAA must be able to account for in developing future 
strategies â€“ for example, investing in both technological systems and human 
resources or working with EU+ countries to develop guidance and anticipatory policy. 

The final mode of scenario analysis was a Delphi-style survey developed to help 
gather insights into the likelihood and time-scale for critical aspects of each 
scenario. Through this method, respondent assessments of scenario-derived 
statements (included in the scenario overview below) provided quantitative and 
qualitative feedback on the content of the scenarios with respect to expert 
knowledge and opinion. The statements are derived from aspects of the scenarios 
that were particularly controversial during the scenario analysis discussions. 
Each Delphi statement was created to crystallize the development of one or more 
key factors as presented within the scenario text as defining differentiators 
between the scenario world of the future and our present situation. While the 
Delphi statements from different scenarios may involve the same key factors, 
the statements are created to accentuate how slight differences in factor 
developments can have large impacts on defining new scenario conditions. The 
Delphi method allows a deeper examination of proposed factor developments, by 
gathering diverse expert assessments on the likelihood of each statement, 
supporting arguments for each assessment, and estimates on when (if ever) such 
a statement might become reality. This data can then used to engage the wider 
community in dialogue regarding complex relationships of change, and might 
provide insights to international protection stakeholders in the EU+ as they 
derive options for action from the scenarios.

Below is a brief overview of each of the four final scenarios and the three 
statements that were used in a Delphi survey to gather expert opinion about each 
scenario. It is important to recall that each scenario is created as a **plausible** 
sketch of a future world, and not meant as a prediction of truth.
