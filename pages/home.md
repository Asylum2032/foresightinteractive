There exists no singular future that we are capable of knowing. As such, the practice of strategic foresight acknowledges that preparing for a variety of futures means creating a sense of familiarity with the scope of future possibilities. This project aims to provide the EUAA and its partners with future-oriented assets and skills to better prepare for and fulfil their mission within a dynamic, rapidly changing world. Through this project’s multiple phases, teams from the EUAA, national asylum authorities and Fraunhofer ISI created a set of coherent future scenarios – narratives that enable policy and decision makers to better perceive and respond to the complexity and uncertainty of possible futures.

To develop coherent and useful alternative future scenarios, first [key factors](factors/hub) that are external to the European Union and influencing the development of international protection and asylum-related migration were identified. Here the term factor refers to trends, emerging issues and novel developments that drive change in international protection. Based on the key factors, four unique and viable **future scenarios** were refined.

An expert-based [Delphi survey](about) helped gather quantitative and qualitative expert feedback into the likelihood and anticipated time-horizon for critical aspects of each scenario. 
Eventually, [critical challenges](challenges/hub) present across the scenarios were identified. The purpose of outlining critical challenges is to help organisations to prioritise and build preparedness and resilience while preparing for a wide spectrum of possible futures. 
Read more about the process of scenario development under the section [About](about).
