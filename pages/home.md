The scenario development process began with the identification of a number of 
factors that were both external to the EU+ countries and driving change in 
international protection. Based on them, the process of scenario development 
followed during three workshops with EUAA staff, representatives of national 
asylum authorities and partner EU institutions. At the end of a multi-workshop 
scenario development process, four unique and viable future scenarios were 
refined in preparation for the scenario analysis process. Each of these scenarios 
centres around three of the most impactful and uncertain factors and details how 
developments among those key factors infer coinciding and coherent developments 
in the other factors.
